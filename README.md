# dna-sequence-analyzer
This is a basic Python command-line tool for analyzing DNA sequences. It reads a DNA sequence from a FASTA file and performs several common bioinformatics operations such as calculating GC content, generating the reverse complement of the sequence, and identifying start and stop codons. The project is useful for beginners.
Features
1.Read DNA sequence from FASTA file
2.Calculate GC content
3.Generate reverse complement of the sequence
4.Detect start codons (ATG) and stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA)
5.Simple and easy-to-understand code structure
6.Can be extended for more advanced tasks like ORF prediction and translation

-->Requirements
1.Python 3
2.Biopython
